2D Top-Down Dungeon Game (Unfinished)

Practice Project I used to try out Unity:
Explored collision-theory, helped player to stop running through walls or game objects.
Experimented with movement mechanics and scripts.
Explored adding assets, map-making and adding collision boxes.
Added treasure chest objects and ability to change the chests state from having gold and being
emptied by player.

Started this unity practice project to try learn something different than java programming or front-end languages,
will return to game design as a hobby after becoming comfortable in back-end and front-end programming.

Running instructions:
1. Clone this repository
2. Execute 'TopDungeonTutorial.exe' in GameExe folder
